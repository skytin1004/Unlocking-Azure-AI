# Building a Basic Chatbot with Azure OpenAI

In this turorial, we'll build a simple chatbot that uses Azure OpenAI to generate responses to user queries.

## Overview

To create a basic chatbot, we need to set up a language model resource that enables conversation capabilities. In this tutorial, we will:

1. Set up the Azure OpenAI resource using the Azure AI Foundry portal.
1. Retrieve the API key needed to connect the resource to your chatbot application.

Once the API key is configured in your code, you will be able to integrate the language model into your chatbot and enable it to generate responses.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working chatbot that can generate responses using the Azure OpenAI model.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Azure OpenAI Resource in Azure AI Foundry

In this step, you'll learn how to set up the Azure OpenAI resource in Azure AI Foundry. Azure OpenAI is a pre-trained language model that can generate responses to user queries. We'll be using it in our chatbot.

1. Open the [Azure AI Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-foundry/) page in your web browser.

2. Login to your Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/).
